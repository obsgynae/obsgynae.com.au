What is Foam? And how do I get involved?

===

## What is FOAM
FOAM (Free Open Access Meducation) means different things to different people. However, [Dr. Mike Cadogen, Life in the Fast Lane](https://litfl.com/foam-free-open-access-medical-education/) provides a succinct summary:
> FOAM is a collection of resources, a community and an ethos... FOAM is independent of platform or media â€” it includes blogs, podcasts, tweets, Google hangouts, online videos, text documents, photographs, Facebook groups, and a whole lot more.

>FOAM should not be seen as a teaching philosophy or strategy, but rather as a globally accessible crowd-sourced educational adjunct providing inline (contextual) and offline (asynchronous) content to augment traditional educational principles.
